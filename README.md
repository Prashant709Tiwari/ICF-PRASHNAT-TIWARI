The assignment requires you to visualize an electrical transmission network represented in an Excel file containing three tabs: Line Data, Generator Data, and Sample SLD. Your task is to programmatically read the data from the Excel sheet and generate a Single Line Diagram (SLD) based on the specifications provided. In the diagram, each bus (node) should be represented by a line rather than a point, and the layout should minimize overlaps between lines for clarity. Different voltage levels must be distinguished using various colors or styles. Generators should be depicted as circles labeled "G," and loads, which are nodes connected at a single point (not in a loop), should be represented by arrows pointing away from the bus. Additionally, when buses of different voltage levels are connected, they should be represented as transformers using two overlapping circles. Bonus points are awarded for creating a visually appealing output with a layout that ensures the diagram is both clear and aesthetically pleasing. The final deliverable should include a Python script that reads the Excel file, generates the diagram, and clear instructions for running the code.
